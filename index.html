        <p>Hi all! My name is Brian Pier and I'm from Orem, Utah here in the USA. I'm a married father of 5 amazing
            kids,<br> 3 still at home with us and 2 that have flown the coop but doing very well though OK I might be
            slightly biased haha.<br>I'm both excited and honestly nervous to being back in school after more than 20
            years, but fortunately<br>my experience so far being part of BYU Pathway has been absolutely amazing and
            such a blessing!</p>

        <p>Utah is one of the most beautiful States in all of the US in my humble opinion! It has a wide array of zones
            and climates, ranging from deserts to mountains to forests and more.</p>
